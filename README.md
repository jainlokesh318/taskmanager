# Task Management Application

## Overview

The Task Management Application is a web-based tool that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can create, update, and delete tasks, each with a title, description, and a status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done"). They can also view a list of tasks and filter them by their status.

The application is built using React, Firebase for the database, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Task Management: Create, update, and delete tasks with titles, descriptions, and statuses.
- Task Filtering: Easily filter tasks by their status (To Do, In Progress, Done).
- Task List: View a list of tasks in an organized manner.

## Advanced Filtering and Search

The Task Management Application is designed to provide a flexible filtering system that can easily accommodate more filtering parameters and search functionality in the future. We've built the filtering feature with extensibility in mind, making it straightforward to add new filter criteria as your needs evolve.

### Current Filtering Options

- **Status Filtering:** You can filter tasks by their status, such as "To Do," "In Progress," or "Done." This is just the beginning; you can easily expand on this by adding more statuses or filtering options.

### Future Enhancements

As your project requirements grow, you can consider adding the following enhancements:

- **Additional Filter Criteria:** Customize the filtering to include more parameters like task assignee, due dates, labels, or any other attributes specific to your use case.

- **Search Functionality:** Implement a robust search feature that allows users to search for tasks using keywords, descriptions, or other task attributes.

- **Sorting:** Add the ability to sort tasks based on various attributes, such as priority or creation date.

With a well-structured codebase, you can continue to extend and enhance the filtering and search capabilities of the application to meet your evolving needs.
